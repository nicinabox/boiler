  Boiler makes package management really, really easy. Gone are the days of scouring forum posts for working plugins.

## Why does boiler exist?

You see, turning your code into an unRAID-compatible Slackware package is a bit of a pain. You need a machine to test with and a way to deploy your code to that machine. You’ll have to remember to bump the version number along the way. You’ll have to come up with a way to store your app’s configuration in a way that won’t get lost on a reboot or a reinstall.

The worst part is, there are no best practices. The solutions you come up with are likely to differ from other packages, creating a disparate ecosystem.

Boiler uses a central registry, but _decentralized_ source code. Packages are created on the fly, on your machine, for best compatibility. Authors maintain their own source code, issues, and releases. Boiler is just the glue.

**Boiler standardizes how packages are designed.** It solves a lot of common problems for you, so you can focus on making a killer app, rather than dealing with annoying problems. It paves the way for better packages, apps, and services on unRAID.

## Who made Boiler?

Hi, I’m Nic Aitch. I’m a professional software engineer with a background in Ruby and JavaScript. I care deeply about design and usability. I believe unRAID can be made better through high quality tooling designed for its unique challenges.
