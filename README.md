## Install

    wget -qO- --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/nicinabox/boiler/master/install.sh | sh -

## Usage

    init                    # Create a boiler.json in the current directory
    install NAME [VERSION]  # Install a package by name
    list                    # List installed packages
    pack DIR                # Pack a directory for distribution
    register NAME URL       # Register a package
    remove NAME             # Remove (uninstall) a package
    search NAME             # Search for packages
    update NAME             # Update package by name

## Creating a package

The simplest package is just directory with a boiler.json file. This project is a boiler package itself (meta!).

1. Create a directory for your project
2. Run `boiler init` in that directory

## Registering a package

Boiler packages use git as the distribution mechanism. Your package must be a publicly available git repo (Github recommended, but not required).

1. Run `boiler register NAME URL`, where NAME is the name of your package, and URL is the git url (use the git:// protocol!)
2. Profit!

## Maintaining your package

Once a package is registered, it does not need to be updated through boiler. Boiler makes use of git tags (use semver!) to deliver a package version. Commit and tag as normal to release your package.

## boiler.json

See this project's boiler.json for a working example.

**name** [string, required] - The name of your package

**version** [string, required] - The version of your package. Should be semver and match git tags

**description** [string] - A description of your package

**authors** [array] - An array of authors. Supports Name <email> syntax.

**license** [string] - Project license

**dependencies** [string] - A hash of dependencies (`"openssl": ">=1.0.1c"`). Maybe use version constraints

**ignore** [array] - Ignore files or directories when building the package

**prefix** [array] - Prefix files or directories with a path during packaging. Useful for mapping directories (say `bin` to, `/usr/local/bin`)

**symlink** [hash] - Define files to be symlinked on install

**post_install** [array] - Define commands to run during post install

## Todo

* Tests
* `boiler info NAME`
* `boiler init` wizard defaults (not working through thor)
* Try to convert non git:// urls, then fail
* Robustness on install (thin dependencies if possible)
* Better error reporting when something fails

## Contributing
