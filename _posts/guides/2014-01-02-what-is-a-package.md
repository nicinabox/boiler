<p class="lead">
  Simply put, Boiler packages are Slackware packages with a layer of icing.
</p>

This so-called icing is a set of conveniences, conventions, and tools that Boiler provides to make creating and consuming a package very simple.

Distributed packages are tarballs designed to be standalone-compatible with Slackware's native pkgtools.

A package can be anything you want to distribute. It could be a web app, a command line tool, daemon, or Slackware package that provides extra functionality to unRAID, like openssh.
