<p class="lead">
  So, you've put a lot of work into your package and now you're ready to release it to the world. Time to register it!
</p>

Easy as pie:

    boiler register hola

By adding your package to the registry, a user can install your package on unRAID:

    boiler install hola

It could take up to 60 minutes for your package to be visible on the registry website, but your package will be available immediately for install.
